This repository contains the datasets necessary to carry out the analysis. The goal is to delve into the company's sales data by combining customer details, order information, product specifics, and product category insights. By consolidating these datasets into a master dataset using SQL in PgAdmin, we aim to create a holistic view of the sales landscape. Leveraging Looker Studio, our focus will be on generating visualizations that offer actionable insights to drive informed decision-making and optimize sales strategies.

* Dataset: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RwsBQ1FriNfz6qiq0V5nD7gF7jO81To3/view

* Objective: Analyze company sales data from four primary datasets: customer, order, product, and product category.

* Data Consolidation: Merge the four datasets into a single master dataset by performing SQL joins in PgAdmin. Select relevant parameters to construct a comprehensive dataset that encompasses vital sales information.

* Visualization and Analysis: Utilize Looker Studio to generate visualizations that provide in-depth insights into sales trends, customer behavior, and product performance. These visualizations will aid in analysis and formulating strategic recommendations for improving sales strategies and business outcomes.

Based on the sales analysis, the following recommendations are proposed:
1. Implement cross-selling promotions between high-selling products, such as the MICR-23K Robot and the Cat Robot Blueprint, to enhance sales of less popular products.
2. Expand marketing efforts by targeting areas with substantial customer presence, such as Washington (89), Houston (73), and San Diego (56), and replicate successful marketing strategies in areas with limited customer presence, including Newport News, Irving, Waterloo, Palmdale, Panama City, and others where the customer count is only one.
3. Conduct a comprehensive customer satisfaction survey to gain insights into customer preferences, allowing Muamalat teams to identify areas of improvement and refine their offerings to better align with customer needs.
4. Initiate in-depth research on Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) analysis to segment customers effectively, allowing for tailored marketing strategies and personalized customer experiences.
