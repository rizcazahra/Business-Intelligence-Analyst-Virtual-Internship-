This repository contains the datasets necessary to carry out the analysis. The goal is to delve into the company's sales data by combining customer details, order information, product specifics, and product category insights. By consolidating these datasets into a master dataset using SQL in PgAdmin, we aim to create a holistic view of the sales landscape. Leveraging Looker Studio, our focus will be on generating visualizations that offer actionable insights to drive informed decision-making and optimize sales strategies.
